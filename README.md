# Word2Vec_game
Association game realized with help of pre trained word2vec Ukrainian language model in order to randomly pick words from certain category. Project was implemented with Low-level networking interface Socket lib. That was done to reduce loading time of model for single user. 
### PS: In order to try application you need to download Ukrainian language word2vec model. I recommend to find it on http://lang.org.ua
## Project was done as lab for Computer Networks course, IASA 2018
